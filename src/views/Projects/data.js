			<p>The Arrivals is a NYC based fashion line focusing on classic, architecturally-inspired garments crafted to last a lifetime and exclusively available online.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I was brought on to lead the responsive front-end development and UX design of <a href="thearrivals.com" target="_blank">TheArrivals.com.</a> from launch to today.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>As the lead front-end engineer and interaction designer I was responsible for the creation and implementation of all front-end code and interface design for a responsive, cross-platform e-commerce web app. As well as designing and developling bi-weekly interactive campaigns, supporting multiple product launches, and improving the site interface based on A/B studies.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Orginally built on top of a LAMP stack using jQuery/PHP for the front-end, I recently led the front-end conversion into reusuable React components and transforming the site into a responsive, single page application.</p>

			<p>Live visuals/VJ'ing projects for live performances or events.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I was asked to create visuals and immersive experiences from music performances, store openings, to fundraising events. Using VDMX as a live controller, I served as VJ for custom generated video content that was manipulated using real-time image processing or with post-production effects.</p>

			<p>What do popular song lyrics say about cultural moods, concerns and political issues of different times?</p>
			<br/>
			<p>To answer this question, I created a Python web scraping script to pull lyrics from the top Billboard charts since it's inception in the early 1900's.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Using this trove of data, I analyzed language patterns to produce detailed visualizations of popular music lyrics; examining relationships between entities (such as "I" and "you"), as well as common verbs that express relationships between those enttities (such as "love", or "hate").</p>
			<p>Topical patterns of time also emerge, such as the use "groovy" in 70's song lyrics, as compared to the 80's/90's when references to more explicit language starts appearing.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Tagging geolocation data to songs, patterns of Western domination of the charts -- with notable bursts appearing from Sweden and the United States -- also appear.</p>
